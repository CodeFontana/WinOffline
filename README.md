# ** NO LONGER UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT **

# WinOffline
WinOffline is a utility designed to simplify IT Client Manager (ITCM) product self-patching and help automate common maintenance procedures, in order to make your day run much smoother.

## License
> Not licensed, use at your own risk.  WinOffline is available on an as-is basis.  If you have a problem or question, we recommend filing a GitHub Issue.

## Requirements
> .NET Framework 4.0 or newer.

## Multi-Purpose Application
> **Interactive mode** -- WinOffline runs locally and displays a graphical user interface.

> **Command Line mode** -- WinOffline executes locally via the command line interface.

> **Software Delivery mode** -- WinOffline is registered as a software package inside ITCM Software Delivery and runs silently without any user interaction on agents.

## WinOffline Debug Log
> During execution -- **%windir%\temp\WinOffline.txt**  
After completion -- **..\CA\DSM\WinOffline\<timestamp\>.txt**

## WinOffline Exit Codes
> 1- Basic process initialization failed.   
2- Environment variable initialization failed.  
3- Windows registry initialization failed.  
4- ITCM common configuration initialization failed.  
5- Another instance of WinOffline is currently in-progress.  
6- WinOffline debug log initialization failed.  
7- Startup switch initialization failed.  
8- External resource extraction failed.   
9- WinOffline execution failed, a review of the log file is required.  
10- WinOffline executed successfully, but an ITCM patching error has occurred.  
Everything Else- .NET Framework is not installed or there are version compatibility issues.  

## Deviations from ApplyPTF functionality
> * When removing a patch that's applied, instead of marking the patch as "backed out" in the history file, WinOffline will erase the previous record showing the patch was ever applied.
> * When applying the same patch multiple times, WinOffline will create an incremental number of folders in the ..\DSM\REPLACED folder.
> * When removing a patch, WinOffline will seek the latest incremental folder matching the patch name, from the ..\DSM\REPLACED folder.
> * WinOffline ignores the following tags in a JCL file: COMPONENT, SUPERSEDE, RELEASE, GENLEVEL, VERSION, PREREQS, MPREREQS, COREQS, MCOREQS.
> * If a patch is already applied, WinOffline will not prompt or require a switch to re-apply a patch.
> * WinOffline does not prompt or require a switch when a patch is applying new files.
> * WinOffline supports JCL files without FILE replacement tags, to facilitate patches that only will run a command/batch script. For example, here's a JCL file that will only run a command script:
```
PLATFORM:WINDOWS
PRODUCT:DTSVMG
SYSCMD:ScriptA.cmd
```

## Custom Supported JCL tags
VERSIONCHECK
> Designate patch is ITCM version specific. The patch will be SKIPPED if the version does not match. Wildcards may be used.

> Examples:  
VERSIONCHECK:14.0.0.199  
VERSIONCHECK:14.0.1000.194  
VERSIONCHECK:14.0.2000.255  
VERSIONCHECK:14.*

Sample JCL file with VERSIONCHECK:
```
PLATFORM:WINDOWS
PRODUCT:DTSVMG
FILE:bin\cfsmcapi.dll
FILE:bin\cfmessenger.dll
VERSIONCHECK:12.9.0.338
```

POSTSYSCMD
> Execute additional script(s) after the CAF service has been restarted since patching.

Sample JCL file with POSTSYSCMD:
```
PLATFORM:WINDOWS
PRODUCT:DTSVMG
COMPONENT:DTSVMG-DTSVMG
RELEASE:R14
GENLEVEL:SP2
VERSION:20010222
PREREQS:
MPREREQS:
COREQS:
MCOREQS:
VERSIONCHECK:14.0.2000.255
PRESYSCMD:Install-VC-Redist-x86.cmd
DEPENDS:vc_redist.x86.exe
FILE:bin\RCGraphics.dll:SKIPIFNOTFOUND:
FILE:bin\rcHost.exe:SKIPIFNOTFOUND:
FILE:bin\RCOS.dll:SKIPIFNOTFOUND:
FILE:bin\rcPropDialog.dll:SKIPIFNOTFOUND:
FILE:bin\rcPropDialog_EN.dll:SKIPIFNOTFOUND:
FILE:bin\rcVideoCapture.dll:SKIPIFNOTFOUND:
POSTSYSCMD:Import-Policy.cmd
DEPENDS:rcHostConfig_sep.xml
```

DEPENDS
> Designate external file dependencies. Useful when delivering scripts to be run by WinOffline that have dependent files.

Sample JCL file with DEPENDS:
```
PLATFORM:WINDOWS
PRODUCT:DTSVMG
FILE:bin\cacertutil.exe
SYSCMD:MyBatchScript.cmd
DEPENDS:HelperScript.cmd
```

WinOffline supports multiple dependencies, either separated by comma or listed individually:

> DEPENDS:SomeFile1.cmd,SomeFile2.dat,SomeFile3.cmd  
--or--  
DEPENDS:SomeFile1.cmd  
DEPENDS:SomeFile2.dat,SomeFile3.cmd

JCL file requirements and formatting:
> * Each JCL file must contain a PRODUCT code.
> * Each JCL file must contain at least one instruction tag (PRESYSCMD, FILE, or SYSCMD).
> * WinOffline supportd JCLs having multiple insturction tags (PRESYSCMD, FILE, or SYSCMD).
> * WinOffline always runs the PRESYSCMD tags, in the order they are found, before performing FILE replacements.
> * WinOffline always runs the SYSCMD tags, in the order they are found, after performing FILE replacements.
> * WinOffline always runs the POSTSYSCMD tags, in the order they are found, after the CAF service is restarted.
> * Similar to the DEPENDS tag, WinOffline also supports multiple comma separated items in the PRESYSCMD or SYSCMD tags.
